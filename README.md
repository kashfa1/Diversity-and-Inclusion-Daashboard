# Diversity-and-Inclusion-Daashboard
 I completed an analysis for a telecom client focused on improving gender balance at the executive level. 
Using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as hiring rates, promotions, performance ratings, and turnover, I created visualizations to highlight the challenges in achieving gender diversity. 
Our findings suggest that strategy, awareness, and better analytics are essential to address the root causes of slow progress in diversity and inclusion.
